# Parking-Management

In this Project i've implemented a parking management module which has seperate capacity for university and general cars which changes according to the time of day.
 
A signal will be sent if a car wants to enter (car_entered) or exit (car_exited) and the modules handles that request according the free capacity of the parking.
